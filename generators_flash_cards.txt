12at is a generator function in JavaScript?	A generator function is a special function that can pause execution and resume later using the yield keyword.

How do you define a generator function?	A generator function is defined using function* syntax.

What keyword is used to pause a generator?	The yield keyword pauses the generator and returns a value.

What does calling a generator function return?	Calling a generator function returns a generator object, not the function result.

How do you start or resume execution of a generator?	By calling the next() method on the generator object.

What is the structure of the value returned by next()?	next() returns an object with properties { value, done }.

What does the done property indicate?	done is true when the generator has finished execution, otherwise false.

Can a generator yield multiple values?	Yes, a generator can yield values multiple times.

What happens when a generator finishes execution?	The done property becomes true and no further values are yielded.

Can generators be iterated using for...of?	Yes, generators are iterable and work with for...of loops.

What happens if you use return inside a generator?	The generator ends and the returned value becomes the final value.

What is the difference between yield and return in a generator?	yield pauses execution, return ends the generator.

Can you pass values into a generator?	Yes, values can be passed using generator.next(value).

What does the first next() call argument do?	The first next() argument is ignored because execution has not reached a yield yet.

What is lazy evaluation in generators?	Generators produce values only when requested, not all at once.

Why are generators memory efficient?	They generate values on demand instead of storing all values in memory.

Can generators be infinite?	Yes, generators can produce infinite sequences using loops.

How do generators differ from normal functions?	Generators can pause and resume execution, normal functions cannot.

Can generators throw errors?	Yes, errors can be thrown into generators using generator.throw().

What is generator.throw()?	It injects an error into the generator at the current pause point.

What is generator.return()?	It forces the generator to finish execution early.

Are generators synchronous or asynchronous?	Generators are synchronous by default.

What is the difference between generators and async functions?	Generators pause with yield, async functions pause with await and return promises.

Can generators be used to build custom iterators?	Yes, generators simplify creating custom iterators.

What symbol makes generators iterable?	Generators implement the Symbol.iterator protocol.

What happens if you call next() after done is true?	It returns { value: undefined, done: true }.

Can a generator yield expressions?	Yes, yield can return any expression value.

Can generators be nested?	Yes, generators can call other generators.

What does yield* do?	yield* delegates iteration control to another iterable.

Can arrays be yielded using yield*?	Yes, yield* can be used with arrays and other iterables.

Why are generators useful?	They simplify iteration, manage state, and handle large or infinite data streams efficiently.

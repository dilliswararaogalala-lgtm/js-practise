      As discussed, the distance formula is used to find the distance between any two points, when we already know the
      coordinates. The points could be present alone on the x-axis or y-axis or in both axes.

      Let us consider, there are two points say A and B in an XY plane. The coordinates of point A are (x1,y1) and of B
      are (x2,y2). Then the formula to find the distance between two points PQ is given by:
